;;; Commentary:

;; mu4e-thread-folding.el is a small library to enable threads folding in
;; mu4e. This works by using overlays with an invisible property and
;; setting hooks at the right place. It is possible to configure colors
;; to better highlight a thread and also to have a prefix string
;; indicating if a thread is folded or not. Note that when a thread is
;; folded, any unread child remains visible.

;; Usage:

;; The prefix string is displayed over the header line and it is thus
;; recommended to have an empty field at the start of an header line.
;; Have a look at ~mu4e-headers-fields~.
